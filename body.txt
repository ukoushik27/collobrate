A paragraph is a distinct unit of writing, typically consisting of several sentences, that focuses on a single idea or topic. It helps organize longer texts by grouping related ideas, making it easier for the reader to follow the flow of thought. A well-structured paragraph often includes a topic sentence that states the main idea, followed by supporting sentences that provide details, examples, and explanations. 
Structure: A paragraph is a collection of sentences that form a coherent unit. 
Topic Sentence: The paragraph's main idea is usually introduced in a topic sentence, which can appear at the beginning, middle, or end. 
Supporting Sentences: Sentences following the topic sentence provide evidence, examples, or further explanation to support the main point. 
Organization: Paragraphs help structure written work, signaling to the reader when a new point or topic is being introduced. 
Conventions: Paragraphs are often indicated by an indentation of the first line or by skipping a line before the new paragraph begins.
